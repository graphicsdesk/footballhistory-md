Favored from the beginning of the year, the Lions lived up to expectations at the end of the season with a 50-0 win against Brown. The Light Blue ended its 1961 campaign with a 6-1 Ivy League record, 6-3 overall.

In 1967, the Lions’ head coach Aldo Donelli retired after 11 seasons with the team and was replaced by Frank Navarro in 1968. Despite the coaching switch, the Lions’ luck did not improve, earning only a  1-6 record in 1969."

Campbell had his own history with the Lions, as a player who had starred on the 1961 championship team and was named to the All-Ivy League team that same year.

During his tenure, Columbia saw a winless season in 1984 for the first time since 1946. Continuing the winless streak was Jim Garrett, a former coach from Susquehanna University. Garett only lasted a year, adding 10 games to the losing streak before a new coach was brought in with the hope of turning things around."

The period of 44 winless games—“the streak”—became an NCAA football record that was eventually overtaken by Prairie View A&M University from 1989 to 1998."

Their next big break came in 2017 with head coach Al Bagnoli’s third season with the Light Blue. Columbia finished with a winning record—8-2 overall and 5-2 in the Ivy League—for the first time in 24 years. The Lions, however, fell back into stagnation within the League after this campaign, consistently finishing in the middle of the table until Bagnoli’s departure in 2022."

Under his leadership, the Lions earned their second title after 63 years, ending the longest title drought in the Ivy League. The Light Blue split the title with Harvard and Dartmouth. Wins against teams like No. 16 Lafayette and last year’s Ivy League champion Yale contributed to the Lions’ 7-3 overall record, and the championship garnered national media attention as the renowned losing team ended its titleless drought."

As Poppe looked back on his historic championship, he focused on the players. “We can enjoy this moment tonight, but after that, these guys that are coming back can’t ride on this anymore, because all these guys are gone, it’s time to move on for the next one,” Poppe said."
