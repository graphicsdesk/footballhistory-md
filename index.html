  West Harlem is set to see hundreds of new trees as early as 2027 under a recently announced New York City Department of Parks & Recreation initiative to plant trees in every available city street location by 2035.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue, who announced the plan on Nov. 8, the initiative aims to plant 18,000 trees annually to meet the city’s 30 percent canopy coverage goal, which was set in November 2023. New York City’s canopy coverage is currently at 22 percent.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While the citywide initiative will operate on a nine-year cycle, the parks department plans for every community board to have at least one zone completed on a shorter three-year cycle. Heat-vulnerable areas, including West Harlem, will be prioritized to reach full completion within three years. The project is funded by $136 million from Mayor Eric Adams’ office.

              Columbia wins their first Ivy League title with head coach Aldo Donelli. They go 6-1 in the League with their only loss coming to Princeton.

              An Ivy League coaching legend from Penn, Al Bagnoli was announced as the new head coach of Columbia football. Bagnoli arrived to replace Pete Mangurian who left after three seasons with the team.

              The 2017 season was the first for the Lions in 21 years. They ended with a record of 8-2 overall with five total Ivy wins.

              Al Bagnoli’s sudden retirement allowed interim coach Mark Fabish to be announced in August prior to the start of the season. Despite his previous time alongside Bagnoli, Fabish only managed a 3-6 record with only one win in the Ivy League coming against Cornell.

  The project aims to reduce rising temperatures that present public health and environmental risks by utilizing trees’ ability to provide shade and improve air quality. Due to inequities in New York City’s heat infrastructure, West Harlem is disproportionately affected by heat as climate change worsens. In 2021, the New York Times reported that a street in East Harlem was 31 degrees warmer than a tree-lined street on the Upper West Side.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  This past summer was one of the hottest on record nationwide<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2024/07/15/community-advocates-raise-concerns-over-extreme-summer-heat-in-west-harlem-as-city-budget-cuts-affect-cooling-centers/">, with West Harlem residents especially impacted by reduced accessibility to cooling centers following Adams’ budget cuts</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In light of the decreased Parks budget, Brad Taylor, president of Friends of Morningside Park and former chair of the Community Board 9 Parks committee, is skeptical that the parks department will adhere to its timeline.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Given Parks dire budget situation I have serious reservations about how they will maintain these trees over time,” Taylor wrote in a statement to Spectator. “I also question why Central Harlem is not included.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The New York City heat vulnerability index measures the risk of heat-related illness or death in different neighborhoods. Though Central Harlem is rated a five out of five on the heat vulnerability index—compared to West Harlem’s three out of five—it was not one of the communities prioritized for the initiative. Morningside Park sits on the border between West and Central Harlem, serving as a green space for both communities.
</p>

          
      
        
            <div class="graphic">
              </div>
          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Central Harlem has relatively little park land and it would seem to need much more planting to mitigate the heat island effect of the many hard surfaces in that district,” Taylor wrote.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The urban heat island effect refers to the phenomenon of urban areas experiencing higher temperatures than surrounding areas due to a lack of greenery and high concentration of buildings and infrastructure.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While the initiative aims to plant trees in street locations, Taylor said he believes that West Harlem has been prioritized because of its high concentration of parks.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I suspect one reason that West Harlem has been selected is that it is easy to meet targets for tree plantings by proposing planting a significant number in our district’s large parks,” Taylor wrote. “However, our parks already have an enormous amount of tree coverage. Adding more to meet a target number of trees for the city will be counterproductive.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  West Harlem resident Pierre Force echoed this sentiment.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There are trees in Riverside Park, which is great, but there could be trees, you know, inside the city itself,” Force said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In a statement to Spectator, Kelsey Jean-Baptiste, Journalism ’20, a press officer for the parks department, shared a <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/street-tree-planting/locations">map</a> that indicates the locations for the scheduled tree planting in West Harlem. According to the map, the trees will be planted on street locations, although many of the locations border parks.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While the project is scheduled to be completed in West Harlem by 2027, and in the whole of New York City by 2035, residents expressed concerns about whether this timeline is achievable.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Taylor also emphasized the need for the city to make additional investments in green spaces beyond tree-planting. He proposed converting excess parking around the city into green space, giving incentives for private buildings to invest in green roofs, and for trees to be introduced in all city playgrounds.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “This initiative could have an important impact but only if the solutions are holistic and involve all aspects of the built environment, not just parks,” Taylor wrote.
